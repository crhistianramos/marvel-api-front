# marvel-api-front

Angular project integrating Angular Material components, interacting with a local microservice providing Marvel character information. The microservice has two endpoints: one for fetching Marvel characters, displayed in the character catalog, and another for querying an individual character. The app also features an authentication module using JWT, storing the token until the page is refreshed. Once logged in, users can view a logbook of queries, including service name, date, and time. Optionally, the character ID is displayed if the query was made by clicking on a character card in the catalog.

**Note**: Credentials are as follows:
- Username: marvelAdmin
- Password: secreto
